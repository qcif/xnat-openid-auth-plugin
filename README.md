# XNAT OpenID Connect Authentication Provider Plugin #

Tested with [Google's OpenID Connect](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect "Google OpenID Connect") and [AAF](https://aaf.edu.au/ "AAF")

## Pre-requisities ##

This plugin is for use with XNAT 1.7.5.x releases.

There are 2 ways to deploy XNAT-Web:



## Deploying this plugin ##

When you have deployed the specific version of XNAT Web, you will need to deploy this XNAT plugin. For more information, please [XNAT documentation on how to deploy plugins.](https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation/xnat-administration/deploying-plugins-in-xnat)

Again there are 2 ways to accomplish this:

### 1. Download the pre-built JAR ###

1. Download the latest development version [here](http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=au.edu.qcif.xnat.openid&a=openid-auth-plugin&v=LATEST&e=jar)

1. Copy the plugin jar to your plugins folder:
    `cp build/libs/xnat-openid-auth-plugin-all-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /data/xnat/home/plugins`

### 2. Build the code and generate the JAR ###

To build the XNAT OpenID authentication provider plugin:

1. If you haven't already, clone [this repository](https://github.com/qcif/xnat-openid-auth-plugin.git) and cd to the newly cloned folder.

1. Build the plugin:

    `./gradlew clean fatJar`

    On Windows, you can use the batch file:

    `gradlew.bat clean fatJar`

  This should build the plugin in the file **build/libs/xnat-openid-auth-plugin-all-_1.0.0-SNAPSHOT_.jar** (the version may differ based on updates to the code).

1. Build the plugin jar or download the latest development version [here](http://dev.redboxresearchdata.com.au/nexus/service/local/artifact/maven/redirect?r=snapshots&g=au.edu.qcif.xnat.openid&a=openid-auth-plugin&v=LATEST&e=jar)

1. Optionally run the tests:    

    `./gradlew clean test`

1. Copy the plugin jar to your plugins folder:

    `cp build/libs/xnat-openid-auth-plugin-all-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /data/xnat/home/plugins`


## Configuring and Testing ##

After deploying the plugin, you will need to configure it.

XNAT searches for authentication plugin configurations by looking for files whose names match the pattern:

    *-provider.properties

It looks in the following locations:

* On the classpath in the folder **META-INF/xnat/auth**
* In a folder named **auth** under the XNAT home folder (usually configured with the **xnat.home** system variable)

This plugin will use any entries located in any of those properties files where the property **type** is set to "openid". See the sample properties in the resources directory.

The following properties control the plugin:

### enabled
Comma delimited list of provide ids, currently tested with Google `google`, AAF `aaf`, and WUSTL `wustl`.

### siteUrl
The main domain, needed to build the full `preEstablishedRedirUri`

### preEstablishedRedirUri
The return leg of OpenID request after the provider has authenticated, defaults to `<siteUrl>/openid-login`

### openid.`providerId`.clientId
The ID obtained on app registration

### openid.`providerId`.clientSecret
The Secret obtained on app registration

### openid.`providerId`.scopes
Controls the scopes returned by the server: `openid,profile,email`

### openid.`providerId`.link
Controls the link HTML snippet displayed on the Login page for this provider. Location of the link text can optionally be customised by modifying `Login.vm`.

### openid.`providerId`.shouldFilterEmailDomains
Controls whether domains of the email should be compared against the whitelist: `allowedEmailDomains`.

### openid.`providerId`.allowedEmailDomains
Comma delimted whitelist of domains.

### openid.`providerId`.forceUserCreate
Allows skipping of user creation, usually set to true.

### openid.`providerId`.userAutoEnabled
Flag to set the `enabled` property of new users, set to false to allow admins to manually enable users before allowing logins, set to true to allow immediate access.

### openid.`providerId`.userAutoVerified
Flag to set the `verified` property of new users.

### openid.`providerId`.userInfoUri
The optional URI of the UserInfo endpoint. If present then a call will be exchanged to this endpoint to collect additional information about the user.

### openid.`providerId`.*Property
The property names used to populate user information during user creation. These are the property names from the information returned from the authentication provider.

### disableUsernamePasswordLogin
Toggle username & password login visibility on the login form

### openid.`providerId`.pkceEnabled
Flag to enable the PKCE feature in the authrozation code grant flow.
